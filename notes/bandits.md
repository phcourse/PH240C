Some resources for multi-arm bandits:

### Theory

- [Lecture notes from EE290: Theory of Multi-armed Bandits and Reinforcement Learning](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jiantao/2902021spring/material.html)
- [Reinforcement Learning:
An Introduction. By Sutton & Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) Section III contains many Frontier examples with coding.

### Coding

- [Inference-bias-t-test-lambda](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2014602118.short) with [R file](https://leishi-rocks.github.io/courses/ph240c/notes/Inference-bias-t-test-lambda.r)
